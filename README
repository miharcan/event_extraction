# 🧠 Event Extraction & Knowledge Graph Builder

This project demonstrates lightweight NLP methods for detecting events, linking entities, and visualizing relationships from text or news data.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The codebase combines three main components:

1. **Event Extraction** – Detects and classifies events from short texts or headlines using TF-IDF similarity and keyword matching.
2. **Semantic Search & Explanation** – Uses transformer embeddings (Sentence-BERT) and GPT-Neo to find and explain relationships between humanitarian event texts.
3. **Knowledge Graph Generation** – Builds and visualizes a directed graph of subjects, verbs, and objects extracted from live news articles using the NewsAPI.

## 🧩 Features
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) via **spaCy**
- Semantic similarity with **SentenceTransformers**
- Text explanation using **GPT-Neo (EleutherAI)**
- Event and entity linking via **string similarity**
- Automatic **Knowledge Graph** creation and visualization with **NetworkX** + **Matplotlib**

---

## ⚙️ Requirements
```bash
pip install spacy scikit-learn pandas numpy sentence-transformers transformers networkx matplotlib newsapi-python python-dotenv
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm


🕸️ Knowledge Graph Example

The graph visualizes extracted events, entities, and their relationships.
