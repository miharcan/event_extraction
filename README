# ðŸ§  Event Extraction

A lightweight Python prototype for detecting and classifying events from short texts or news headlines using simple NLP and semantic similarity techniques.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview
This project demonstrates a basic event extraction pipeline that:
- Identifies event types (e.g. explosion, protest, earthquake) using TF-IDF similarity  
- Extracts named entities (locations, GPEs) via **spaCy**  
- Optionally links entities using cosine similarity and builds small event graphs with **NetworkX**

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- **Semantic event detection** using TF-IDF and cosine similarity  
- **String-based keyword matching** as fallback extraction  
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** for geographic entities  
- **Knowledge graph visualization** of events and locations

```bash
pip install spacy scikit-learn pandas numpy networkx matplotlib
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
